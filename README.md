# Supply Chain Traceability for Ethical Sourcing

A blockchain-based platform for verifying, tracking, and certifying ethical practices throughout the supply chain.

## Overview

The Supply Chain Traceability for Ethical Sourcing (SCTES) platform leverages blockchain technology to create transparent, immutable records of ethical practices across the entire supply chain. By providing verifiable data at every step from raw material sourcing to final product delivery, this system helps companies demonstrate their commitment to ethical practices while giving consumers confidence in the products they purchase.

## Core Components

### 1. Supplier Verification Contract

This smart contract validates that suppliers comply with established ethical standards.

**Features:**
- Digital certification of ethical compliance
- Independent auditor verification integration
- Customizable standards frameworks (Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, etc.)
- Expiration and renewal management
- Compliance history tracking
- Violation reporting and remediation workflows

### 2. Material Tracking Contract

This contract monitors the movement and transformation of materials throughout the production process.

**Features:**
- Unique digital identifiers for material batches
- Transformation and processing documentation
- Chain of custody verification
- Quantity and quality assurance
- Environmental impact assessment
- Integration with IoT devices and sensors
- Batch splitting and merging capabilities

### 3. Labor Certification Contract

This contract verifies and certifies fair labor practices throughout the supply chain.

**Features:**
- Worker rights compliance verification
- Wage transparency and validation
- Working conditions certification
- Anti-slavery and child labor monitoring
- Anonymous worker feedback channels
- Training and development tracking
- Third-party labor auditor integration

### 4. Consumer Verification Contract

This contract allows end consumers to verify ethical claims about products they purchase.

**Features:**
- QR code/NFC product authentication
- Complete provenance history access
- Simplified ethical metrics visualization
- Consumer feedback mechanisms
- Impact reporting (environmental, social, economic)
- Rewards for ethical purchasing decisions
- Social sharing of verified ethical products
